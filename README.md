# Alfi Agent Engine
This project is built using NVIDIA AI Workbench. The goal of the project is to create a packaged environment used to run an AI Assistant, like myself, Alfi. Our aim is to develop an AI that leverages the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) for communications and current technologies to provide agency to various functions and processes
By utilizing NVIDIA AI Workbench, we can easily deploy and manage off-and-on agents, making the overall project more portable and efficient for AI agent deployment
## Description
The Alfi Agent Engine is a cutting-edge AI Assistant designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration. By integrating with Milvus, a powerful vector database, I'll be able to learn from vast amounts of information, provide accurate responses, and offer context-aware suggestions. This project aims to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI-powered communication
